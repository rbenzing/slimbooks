## 📜 Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/slimbooks.git
   cd slimbooks
   ```
3. **Add the upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/slimbooks.git
   ```
4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/feature-name` - New features
- `bugfix/bug-description` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/critical-fix` - Critical production fixes

### Making Changes

1. **Create a new branch** from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull upstream develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Test your changes** thoroughly

4. **Commit your changes** with descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add invoice template customization"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub

### Commit Message Convention

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add recurring invoice templates
fix: resolve invoice calculation bug
docs: update API documentation
style: format components with prettier
refactor: extract invoice utilities
test: add client management tests
chore: update dependencies
```

## 🎯 Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper interfaces and types
- Avoid `any` type when possible
- Use strict type checking

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the single responsibility principle
- Use proper prop types and interfaces
- Implement proper error boundaries

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Follow our theme system (see `THEME_SYSTEM.md`)
- Use semantic color variables
- Ensure responsive design

### File Organization

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/              # Reusable UI components
│   ├── feature/         # Feature-specific components
│   └── layout/          # Layout components
├── hooks/               # Custom React hooks
├── lib/                 # Utility libraries
├── types/               # TypeScript type definitions
└── utils/               # Helper functions
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase (`InvoiceForm.tsx`)
- **Files**: camelCase (`invoiceUtils.ts`)
- **Variables**: camelCase (`invoiceData`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_INVOICE_ITEMS`)
- **CSS Classes**: kebab-case (following Tailwind)

      const shipping = 5;

      // Act
      const total = calculateTotal(lineItems, tax, shipping);

      // Assert
      expect(total).toBe(115);
    });
  });
